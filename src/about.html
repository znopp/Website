                <p class="mb-5">
                    I've so far graduated from my 12th year of education, where
                    the last three were attending a tech-oriented school featuring programming, web-dev and more.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-5">
                    Since school systems vary between countries, I can't give it a definitive name.
                    However, if it helps, my next level of education would be attending a university.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-5">
                    On my more technological side, I enjoy programming, using and understanding technology.
                    However, I do also love watching movies and tv-shows, as well as gaming (mostly Minecraft) on my PC.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-5">
                    If you've known me from years past, and are confused why I call myself Lily:
                    Surprise... I'm trans! I haven't gotten far into my transition yet, but I'm working on it.
                    Life's a process, so I'm taking it one step at a time. Even if one of those steps is simply working up towards taking the next.
